# Private Events

Welcome to the Private Events repository, a web application inspired by Eventbrite. This application allows users to create their own events, manage signups, and attend multiple events. It's the perfect platform for organizing and attending private gatherings, whether it's a small party at "Andy's House" or a large event at a public venue.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login functionality to manage your events and attendance.
- **Event Creation**: Users can create events, specifying the details such as the date, time, and location.
- **Event Management**: As an event organizer, you have the ability to manage your event's details and view the list of attendees.
- **Attend Events**: Users can browse through available events and choose to attend, with the ability to keep track of upcoming and past events they're interested in.
- **Location-Based Events**: Each event is associated with a specific location, making it easy to organize and attend local gatherings.
